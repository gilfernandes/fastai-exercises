title: Practical Deep Learning for Coders, v3
---

## Getting started

Welcome! If you're new to all this deep learning stuff, then don't worry&mdash;we'll take you through it all step by step. We do however assume that you've been coding for at least a year, and also that (if you haven't used Python before) you'll be putting in the extra time to learn whatever Python you need as you go. (For learning Python, we've heard good things about the [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science) course, as well as [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/).)

### Using a GPU

To do nearly everything in this course, you'll need access to a computer with an NVIDIA GPU. However, we don't recommend you buy one; in fact, even if you already have one, we don't suggest you use it just yet! Setting up a computer takes time and energy, and you want all your energy to focus on deep learning right now. Therefore, we instead suggest you rent access to a computer that already has everything you need preinstalled and ready to go. Costs will generally be around US$0.50 to US$1.25 per hour while you're using it. Here are some great choices:

#### Ready to run options

These are the easiest to use; they've got all the software, data, and lessons preinstalled for you. Click the link for more information on each, and setup instructions.

- [Sagemaker]()
- [Crestle]()
- [Paperspace Gradient]()
- [Salamander](salamander_tutorial)

#### Some installation required

If you're comfortable at a command line, these options are fairly easy to get started with, and may be more flexible in the long term than the options above.
